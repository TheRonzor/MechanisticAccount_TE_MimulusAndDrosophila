To replicate the data found in "Population genetics of transposable element load: a mechanistic account of observed overdispersion", Smith et al.

For Drosophila data:
- Unzip the TEPopGen.zip
- All relevant source files, code, and output contained in the Drosophila folder
- You only need to run the MakeTESummaries_Dros.ipynb notebook


For Mimulus data:
- Unzip the TEPopGen.zip
- Within the 'Mimulus' folder:
  - All relevant data, code, and output contained in this folder
  - First run 'A_DoAnalysis.m' in MATLAB
  - Then run 'Output4Python.m' - this will output the relevant files to run:
  - MakeTESummaries_Mim.ipynb

The author of this code, RD Smith, apologizes that part of the data processing is in MATLAB and the other part is in Python.  This project has been in the works for some time, during which, said author switched preferences.
